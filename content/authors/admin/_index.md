I am currently a fourth-year PhD student based at the University of Sheffield. I spend my working time researching where the most massive Black Holes live, and the impact they can have on their surrounding galaxies. Most of my academic interests involving pushing the bondaried of Bayesian statistics in Astronomy. For academic research, see my [Publications](http://127.0.0.1:4321/#featured) tab.  

Outside of work, I am mostly interested in sport (primarily Rugby League). On my Blog, I intend to write short blogs highlighting some intersting and fascinating statistics of Rugby League. I also coach, referee and (well, at least, used to) play.
