I am currently a fourth-year PhD student based at the University of Sheffield. I spend my working time researching where the most massive Black Holes live, and the impact they can have on their surrounding galaxies. Most of my academic interests involving pushing the boundaries of Bayesian statistics in Astronomy. For academic research, see my publications below.

I am available for statistics help/consultation. I can usually help with anything from building statistical progammes to data analysis. Interested parties should contact me using the form on this website and I will be in touch as soon as possible.

Outside of work, I am mostly interested in sport (primarily Rugby League and Boxing) and politics and usually give my opinions on [twitter](https://twitter.com/LiamGrimmett).
